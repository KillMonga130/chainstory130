# Chain Story Requirements Document

## Introduction

Chain Story is a collaborative storytelling game built for Reddit's Devvit platform where community members work together to create stories one sentence at a time. Players submit sentences, the community votes using Reddit's upvote system, and the highest-voted sentence each hour becomes the official continuation of the story. Stories complete at 100 sentences and are permanently archived, creating a leaderboard of the best community-created stories.

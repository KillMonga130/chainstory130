## Chain Story - Collaborative Storytelling Game

A real-time collaborative storytelling game built on Reddit's Devvit platform where communities work together to create epic 100-sentence stories through democratic voting and creative collaboration.

### What is Chain Story?

Chain Story transforms Reddit into a dynamic collaborative writing platform where every community member becomes a co-author. Players submit sentences to continue an ongoing story, and the community votes on the best contributions using Reddit's native upvote system. Every hour at the top of the hour (UTC), the highest-voted sentence becomes the official next part of the story. When a story reaches exactly 100 sentences, it's completed, archived, and celebrated on the leaderboard while a fresh story automatically begins.

The game features a clean, mobile-optimized interface with three main sections:
- **Story Tab**: View the current collaborative story, real-time countdown timer, and submit your own sentences with live character validation (10-150 characters)
- **Leaderboard Tab**: Browse the top 10 completed stories ranked by community votes with expandable previews and sharing options
- **Archive Tab**: Explore all completed stories with pagination, sorting options (by date or popularity), and full-text viewing capabilities

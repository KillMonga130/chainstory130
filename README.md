# 👻 The Haunted Thread 🕯️

A collaborative horror story experience built with Devvit Web where the Reddit community shapes a spine-chilling narrative together through democratic choice-based voting! This is an advanced interactive storytelling platform that combines real-time voting, atmospheric horror design, and sophisticated state management to create a unique community-driven narrative experience.

## 🎮 What This Game Is

**The Haunted Thread** is a real-time collaborative horror storytelling experience where Reddit users collectively write a branching horror story through democratic voting.
